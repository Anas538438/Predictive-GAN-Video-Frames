# Predictive-GAN-Video-Frames
A Predictive GAN for video frame prediction using the UCF101 dataset. Uses Conv2D, residual blocks, and sequence discriminators for realistic, temporally coherent frames. Tracks progress with L1 loss &amp; discriminator losses. Limited by computational power but shows promising results!
